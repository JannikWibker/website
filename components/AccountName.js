  AFTER the initial render because react checks the checksum of the
  existing component (which was rendered on the server) against the
  new checksum. To avoid a warning the component needs to be rendered
  once exactly the same as it was on the server, after that it is not
  important anymore. This way ensures that the initial render on the
